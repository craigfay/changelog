# About
This is a place I've committed to record interesting things I learn about development, or want to revisit.

### July 8, 2019
* docker-compose can do [variable substitution](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#variable-substitution) based on a `.env` file
* **REVISIT** docker-compose can do [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#build) to handle differences between development/production etc..

### July 9, 2019
* When you open a file with vim, a `.swp` suffixed copy is created that represents unsaved changes. It won't be cleaned up if vim exits abnormally.
* Delete the entire contents of a file with vim: `ggdG`
* Move lines vertically with vim: `:m+` and `:m-2`
